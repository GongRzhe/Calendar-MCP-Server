## Installation

```

## Setup

1. Create a Google Cloud Project and obtain credentials:

   a. Create a Google Cloud Project:
      - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
      - Create a new project or select an existing one
      - Enable the Google Calendar API for your project

   b. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
      - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
      - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
      - Choose "Desktop app" as application type
      - Give it a name and click "Create"
      - You will get your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`

   c. Get Refresh Token:
      - Go to [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/)
      - Click the gear icon (Settings) in the top right
      - Check "Use your own OAuth credentials"
      - Enter your OAuth Client ID and Client Secret
      - In the left panel, find "Calendar API v3" and select "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar"
      - Click "Authorize APIs" and complete the OAuth flow
      - Click "Exchange authorization code for tokens"
      - Copy the "Refresh token" - this is your `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`

2. Configure in Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "calendar": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "@gongrzhe/server-calendar-mcp"
    ],
    "env": {
      "GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
      "GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here",
      "GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN": "your_refresh_token_here"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

The server provides several tools that can be used through the Claude Desktop:

### Create Event
```json
{
  "summary": "Team Meeting",
  "start": {
    "dateTime": "2024-01-20T10:00:00Z"
  },
  "end": {
    "dateTime": "2024-01-20T11:00:00Z"
  },
  "description": "Weekly team sync",
  "location": "Conference Room A"
}
```

### List Events
```json
{
  "timeMin": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "timeMax": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z",
  "maxResults": 10,
  "orderBy": "startTime"
}
```

### Update Event
```json
{
  "eventId": "event123",
  "summary": "Updated Meeting Title",
  "start": {
    "dateTime": "2024-01-20T11:00:00Z"
  },
  "end": {
    "dateTime": "2024-01-20T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Delete Event
```json
{
  "eventId": "event123"
}
```

## Security Notes

- Keep your Google API credentials secure
- Regularly rotate your refresh tokens
- Store sensitive information in Claude Desktop configuration
- Never share or commit your credentials to version control
- The refresh token gives access to your Google Calendar, treat it like a password
